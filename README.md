# ServerCraft
Minecraft Server Configuration Tool

Allows an end user to open up the server.properties file and make the necessary configuration changes with ease.
Prevents the user from entering invalid values.
All options have tooltips that mirror http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Server.properties for ease of use.

This is based on Version 1.8.8 and doesn't handle "Classic" server properties (yet).
These properties have been live since Version 1.8.7 and as such, this program should handle them too.

TO INSTALL/USE
--------------
Just run the ServerCraft.exe from the bin/Release folder.


NOTE FOR DEVELOPERS
-------------------
This relies heavily on DevExpress (Version 15).
