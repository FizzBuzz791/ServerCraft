# ServerCraft
Minecraft Server Configuration Tool

Allows an end user to open up the server.properties file and make the necessary configuration changes with ease.
Prevents the user from entering invalid values.
All options have tooltips that mirror http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Server.properties for ease of use.

Split into two sections; 
- Basic Settings
-- These are the "bare minimum" settings. Taken from a brand new, untouched server.properties file.
- Advanced Settings
-- Any other settings on the above link that aren't in the Basic Settings.

This is based on Version 1.8.8 and doesn't handle "Classic" server properties (yet).
These properties have been live since Version 1.8.7 and as such, this program should handle them too.

NOTE: This relies heavily on DevExpress (Version 15).
